    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am currently a computer science major at Iowa State University, planning to branch out as a Software Engineer or Web Developer. <br>
    Though, I am inexperience in many areas, but I am willing to learn because I enjoy coding. Coding brings out my passion for it, which is why I am taking  <br>
    Udemy course to expand my knowledge and hone my coding skills that will help others.
